ORM
Object-relational mapping is a code library that automates the transfer of data in relational database tables into application code.
It provides a bridge between relational datatables, relationships and fields and python objects

In this project we use SQLAlchemy ORM and its DBAPI
DBAPI is a standard that encourages the use of the same API to work with a variety of databases. HEre we use the default DBAPI for MySQL which is MySQLdb
